{"name": "Real Bird Skeleton - an unusual oddity and curiousity, of an avian skeleton inside a glass display tube.", "price": "$34.95", "location": "", "details": "Handmade", "description": "Another additions to the cabinet of curiosities is a bird skeleton, the name of which is printed on the label. Our supply varies so the type of bird will vary. Please see the pictures for what is available. When we have more than one, you will have the option to select which one you'd like to purchase. The picture, upon selection, will show you what your purchase looks like. The bird is approximately 3.5 inches long from top of head to bottom of the feet. We work with these skeletons to adapt them for storage in a glass tube, one of our standard glass storage tubes. As with all of our tube products, the label is aged --and the cork, too!\n\n***NOTE!! Although the little bird can be removed from the tube, we recommend significant caution if you remove it to ensure it does not break. Actually, it's probably better to keep it in its tube. We carefully extracted it during picture taking so that you can get a better view of it.****\n\nStandard shipping is extra.", "url": "https://www.etsy.com/search?q=[KW]&order=price_desc&view_type=gallery&ship_to=US&explicit=1&page=1\n"}
