(image above).\n\nFrigate birds are a family of seabirds which are found across all tropical and subtropical oceans. Frigate birds were called Man-of-War birds by English mariners and are able to soar for weeks on wind currents.\n\nThese pendants were worn around a man's neck to keep him safe in danger and to straighten the aim and strengthen the arm to shoot. They were also by women in hope of having more children.\n\nUnique to my shop.\n\nThank you for visiting.\n\nPLEASE NOTE:\nFrom the 1st July 2022 - 12 October 2022 I will be in Ubud, Bali finishing my intermediate level silversmith course.
