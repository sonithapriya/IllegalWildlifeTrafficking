So, basically the only thing we waste is the snakes 'Hissssss'.\n\nThese bottles are small (as you can see in the picture)\nLabel reads Rattlesnake Vertebra.\n\nWe do NOT recommend opening the bottle to get a closer look.\n\nThese Vertebra are off of a real Western Diamondback Rattlesnake that is native to our part of Texas.\n\nSupplies are limited!!\n\nBuyer assumes all responsibility involving State Game Laws and the shipping and/or receiving of this product.", "url": "https://www.etsy.com/search?q=[KW]&order=price_desc&view_type=gallery&ship_to=US&explicit=1&page=1\n"}
