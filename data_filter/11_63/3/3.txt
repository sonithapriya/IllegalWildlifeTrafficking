I relish the old ways and incorporate them Into my crafts whenever possible. Each Prayer Feather is made from a genuine wild and/or domestic turkey feather. It is wrapped with hand cut strips of deerskin. It includes horn hairpipe & glass beads. I cut my own wrappings and never use plastic. Nice size wing feathers in great condition. Feathers are apx. 12 - 13\" long but may be slightly smaller. All feathers are acquired humanely, I use the feathers that Nature provides. This allows various colors and patterns. Some may be BLACK, WHITE, STRIPED or MOTTLED. They may be from wild and/or domestic birds. There May Be Slight Natural Defects. All feathers are cleaned prior to crafting and smudged before shipping. A legend is included.\n\nSales are final. Damaged items will be replaced. Photos must be sent.\n\nI am a member of the Cherokee Tribe of NE Alabama.
