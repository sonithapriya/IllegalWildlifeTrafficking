{"name": "Real Whole Cowhide Leather Hide - Large Leather Pieces - approximately 6 feet x 6 feet 36 SF. Sizes vary from one hide to another", "price": "$129.00+", "location": "", "details": "Materials: cow hides", "description": "Whole cowhide leather hides. Colors are on this listing but I receive other colors so if you are looking for a color, let me know. Note I cannot match exact colors, just shades. Each hide is a different shade so I'm selling in groups and the leather you receive may vary from the pictures but will be in the same family. If you want to know the exact color I will be sending please message me either before or after you place your order and I will send you a picture prior to shipping. You can see a few samples of the colors in my pictures.\n\nThese are full cowhides, approximately 36 square feet (6 feet x 6 feet). The sizes vary from one hide to another. These are real leather hides and vary in thickness from 1.2 mm to 1.8mm and vary in size also. The finish also varies. There may be some wrinkles or imperfections within the hide. The wrinkles can be removed by ironing the back on a medium setting with a towel put over the leather.\n\nThe whole cowhides are soft and supple, perfect if you are making larger items including handbags, totes, purses, pocketbooks, gun cases, small furniture pieces, pillows, and much more.\n\nShips from North Carolina. Expect to receive in 2-3 days Eastern USA and 3-5 days rest of country.\n\nI have a number of colors not listed so if you are looking for a color not listed, message me and I'll send you a picture of what I have. Please note I cannot match exact colors over the internet. For example, I can send a light, medium or dark gray but not a specific shade of light gray. If you are trying to match an existing piece of leather I recommend you find your closest fabric retail store that sells leather or an automotive upholstery shop.\n\nTo see all my listings visit my store: https://www.etsy.com/shop/LeatherLadyNC", "url": "https://www.etsy.com/search?q=[KW]&order=price_desc&view_type=gallery&ship_to=US&explicit=1&page=1\n"}
