{"name": "Cow Leather Half Hides - Various colors - Size: 3' x 5' or larger - varies by hide", "price": "$65.00", "location": "", "details": "Materials: cow leather, calf leather", "description": "Cow Leather half hides in various colors. I've heard from a lot of you who want larger pieces but do not need a full hide so I'm offering half hides. They are around 3' x 5' (15 square feet), and range up to 4' x 7'. I am selling them in shades, not specific colors. Look at the pictures to see what you can expect to receive within the shade you choose. The leather hides are irregular in shape, so a 3' x 5' hide might be 4' in one area and 6' in another.\n\nThese hides are used in making furniture so they are soft and flexible and range in thickness from 3 to 6 ounces or 1/16\" to 3/32\" (1.2mm to 2.0 mm). That is about as thick as a dime to a quarter. The hides may contain minor imperfections, which is normal in all except really expensive hides.\n\nThe shades I'm presently offering are light, medium, and dark brown, gray, distressed hides which are mostly brown or black, cream, and even some gold. This leather should be perfect if you are making larger items, like purses, handbags, shoes, clothing, or just want a large piece of leather that is the same color.\n\nI have a number of colors not listed so if you are looking for a color not listed, message me and I'll send you a picture of what I have. Please note I cannot match exact colors over the internet. I can send browns, grays, etc but not an exact match of something.", "url": "https://www.etsy.com/search?q=[KW]&order=price_desc&view_type=gallery&ship_to=US&explicit=1&page=1\n"}
