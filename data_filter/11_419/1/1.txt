The eagle represents enlightenment reached through inner work, understanding and reclaiming our personal power. Tenacity, clear vision and patience, living in balance with Spirit and Earth.\nEAGLE: connects one with Great Spirit, the Great Mystery, opening the soul to greater healing. It tells you that the universe is giving you the opportunity to fly above your life's worldly levels, or above the shadow of past realities, granting yourself permission to be free in order to reach all the joy that your heart desires and Spirit requires.\n\nMany shamans, psychic healers, mystics and mediums have owl medicine either as a primary totem or can call upon one as needed. They can see clear through to the core reason for any type of imbalance and then they can spot the proper medicine needed to heal the imbalance.
