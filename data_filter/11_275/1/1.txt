For many artisans here, leather working goes far beyond simply earning a livelihood. Leather here is a status symbol. It\u2019s in our blood. We\u2019re extremely proud of the work we do.\n\nThis genuine sheepskin was made in Turkey by highly skilled artisans who share our passion for superior materials, exceptional design, and meticulous attention to detail.\n\nWorking with leather is truly an art form. Each hide has its own unique characteristics and requires highly specialized skill to take it from raw material to an elegant, finished design.\n\nWhen it comes to leather, sheepskin is as soft as it gets. Lightweight and extremely smooth, sheepskin is much thinner than cowhide and other leathers, and it offers a flattering drape. Many of the finest leather jackets, shoes, and high-end furnishings are crafted from sheepskin.\n\nPossible uses: Coats, Jackets,Clothing, Accessories, Bags, Pillows, Book covers, Purses, Boots, Shoes, Bracelets, Straps, Table Runner, Corsets, Vests, Costumes Watch bands Dresses / Skirts, Wraps, Handbags, Hats, Hatbands .It\u2019s a perfect weight for all your moccasins, Mukluks, mitt and gauntlets linings.
