They have dirt, weeds, cobwebs and dried cartilage on some. You may even end up with a live BUG! These are not really for displaying IN your home without a little elbow grease. Easiest way to kill any unwanted guests is to put everything into a large trash bag and spray some bug killer (flea/tick or flying insect) into the bag and tie it shut overnight. OR, put the bones in your freezer if you want a chemical free method. Carefully heating the teeth above 125 degrees F will also kill most all unwanted guests.\n\nTeeth may have weathering, moss, coyote chews, broken spots, cracks, be partials, etc.\n\nWe always have a variety of other bones and skulls available, just convo me with your request!\n\nThanks!\n\nShelby", "url": "https://www.etsy.com/search?q=[KW]&order=price_desc&view_type=gallery&ship_to=US&explicit=1&page=1\n"}
