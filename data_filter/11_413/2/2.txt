{"name": "Black prarie dog foot & otter teeth on vintage gold bar brooch//taxidermy jewelry//taxidermy paw pin//taxidermy brooch/taxidermy claw brooch", "price": "$65.00", "location": "", "details": "Handmade item", "description": "Real prairie dog, or ground squirrel, (Cynomys sp. ) foot with claws measures 1.25 inches and has been dyed black. The two .75 inch small otter teeth hang on either side. The 1.5 inch raw brass, vintage bar is circa 1960 and the contemporary silvertone 1.25 inch pin on back has been added. The caps holding the foot and teeth are gold plated. The foot including bar pin hangs to 2.5 inches.\n\nPrairie dogs have become over populated in the region of the Dakotas and need their numbers to be in check for the environment. We get them from the government officials who do this job. No part of these animals are wasted, with the bulk of the body used for food, probably for feeding pigs on a farm.\nThe little claws are naturally sharp and pointy, so take care not to wear with knit fabrics that they could get caught on. As with all of the taxidermy and preserved animal parts used in our jewelry, they have been professionally cleaned, sanitized and preserved. The South American river otters are farmed for their fur. No mammal has ever been killed for the purpose of being incorporated into our jewelry. We use only by-products. For more information, see the FAQ section on our page.\n\nThis piece of jewelry is sent in a bubble pack envelope via US postal service, first class mail with insurance, free in the US and packed in an animal print gift box.\nInternational rate is $15.\nBuyers are responsible for any customs and import taxes that may apply. These fees are taken by your country, not Etsy. Necromance is not responsible for delays due to customs.", "url": "https://www.etsy.com/search?q=[KW]&order=price_desc&view_type=gallery&ship_to=US&explicit=1&page=1\n"}
