Typically on Mondays and Fridays.\n\nOur products are not toys and are not intended for children or pets. In purchasing this product you accept all responsibility and acknowledge we are not responsible for any injuries or damages resulting from the use or misuse of this product.\n\nPlease see our other listings to view our other gator products.\n\nNOTE: All of our alligator products are from legally harvested gators. They all come from Louisiana alligators that were harvested either during government-regulated hunts or by licensed farms, which are legally permitted to harvest gators. We maintain, through the Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, licenses for conducting business as an alligator parts retailer/dealer.\n\nSorry, due to strict export regulations we do not offer international shipping at this time.", "url": "https://www.etsy.com/search?q=[KW]&order=price_desc&view_type=gallery&ship_to=US&explicit=1&page=1\n"}
