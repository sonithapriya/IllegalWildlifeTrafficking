Chloe lays unfertilized eggs routinely, and is not stressed or upset in anyway when I take them from her.\n\nEach egg is roughly 1 1/2 inches tall (they all vary slightly), and is set into a display cube that is 2 1/4 inches. The eggs are glued in, to ensure that they don't break.\n\n*Each egg also comes with a small handwritten label that is attached to the bottom of the display with double sided tape. You can choose to leave it hidden, or move it to the visible portion of the display, depending on your own personal taste/preference.\n\n*As of right now, these only ship within the US*", "url": "https://www.etsy.com/search?q=[KW]&order=price_desc&view_type=gallery&ship_to=US&explicit=1&page=1\n"}
