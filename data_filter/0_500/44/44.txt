The mightiest predator that has ever roamed the seas, Megalodon (\"large tooth\") lived between 23 to 3.6 million years ago. Its teeth were much larger and thicker than any other shark, giving it the most powerful bite of the animal kingdom. This terrifying beast of prey could indeed bite clean through the head of large whales. An exceptional and fascinating creature, Megalodon was the largest shark that ever lived. It may have been up to 60 feet (18.30 meters) long and could have weighed up to 60 tons. Its closest living relative is the Mako shark, which only grows to be 14 feet (4.30 meters) long.\n\nCondition: \nHeight with stand 6 3/4 inches (17.2 cm).", "url": "https://www.auctionzip.com/auction-lot/a-megalodon-shark-tooth-otodus-megalodon_59945388EF/"}
