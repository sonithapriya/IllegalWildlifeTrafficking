Please inquire for a quote prior to bidding.\n\nWestern Europe or Eurasia, France or China, Miocene, ca. 2.5 to 2 million years ago. This is an amazing skull from a fossilized prehistoric predatory feline, Megantereon cultridens, with massive saber tooth canines- iconic of these ancient cats! The coloration of the bone and teeth is excellent- creamy white and beige, with top quality professional preparation that beautifully displays this awe inspiring and rare creature! The blade like teeth create such a striking and distinctive look to these cats, and here this specimen has been displayed with the jaw hanging open, either a snarl or about to bite. The saber tooth to skull ratio of Megantereon is the largest of any of the saber-toothed cats, and this appears to be an adult female. Size: 9.75\" L x 5.25\" W (24.8 cm x 13.3 cm); 9\" H (22.9 cm) on included custom stand; saberteeth: 3.625\" L (9.2 cm) and 3.7\" L (9.4 cm)\n\nMegantereon was ancestor to Smilodon, aka, the Sabretooth tiger. Built like a modern-day jaguar, these cats preferred open scrubland rather than forests, using strength and speed to ambush prey and sever their neck arteries with their saber canines. The quality and rarity cannot be stressed enough- the value of these specimens is astronomical from a collector and scientific standpoint!\n\nProvenance: private Rome, Georgia, USA collection\n\nAll items legal to buy/sell under U.S. Statute covering cultural patrimony Code 2600, CHAPTER 14, and are guaranteed to be as described or your money back.\n\nA Certificate of Authenticity will accompany all winning bids.\n\nWe ship worldwide and handle all shipping in-house for your convenience.\n\n#170220\n\nCondition: \nAs with almost all fossils of its type, this example has areas of repair with minor restoration at the breaks.
