My first of the \"Skully\" series projects.\nIt's from a project started years ago but now made wearable!\nThere are lots of updates and that made it better overall.\nOne of them includes sustaining the more complex intersection with the jaw to the temple.\nThis skull was originally based on the ancestral wolf.\nIt has been modded from there to fit and have much better vision.\n\nThey take 2-3+ weeks to make 1 saying if there's no failure and not having to restart.\nTypically time is added between material shipments, machine maintenance, and if there are multiple orders in line.\nThe process can be gruesome but budget friendly, like this Skully!\nThe details heavily strain my machine and will need more maintenance so there may only be a limited amount produced however.\nThey look amazing to look at and fun to wear once completed. They will not get as hot as many other masks out there!\n\u2022Note: Weathering and other finishes can add extra days over the official ship by time.\n5-7 layers is typical and each layer needs to cure for about a day after scrubbing.\nInstallations such as RGB LEDs will also add extra days.\nEPX coatings need extra time for curing.\n\nWork hours 100-125+\n(Including machine hours)\nParts 2-4 (Depending)\n\n\nSize of Skully: Large (length is 16-17\")\nFits average adult head ~22\" or a tad smaller (add larger foam strips).\nOverall feel: Smooth on top one way, rough on some edges. Might be rough on the inside.\nThere may be some edging where the partition is combined around the top of the head but this can be sanded, filled or left as is.\nOverall look: Banded up close, with possible minimal strings and blemishes.\nVoxel-like edging in some close up areas.\n\nFeatures:\nPre-assembled 2 part Jaw+Head piece\nIntegrated hidden hinge/fitting\nNo metal! (Only exceptions are headstrap options that can include small screws)\nChin gap for adding 1\" width elastic strap(s)\nDesigned for elastic strap builds for a snap-back jaw effect (Does not include straps)\nNostril holes for LEDs, airflow (note these can be broken with pliers and filled out if you don't want the nose bridge)\nIntersection of jaw and head pops through (more realism)\nAdequate number of teeth with alignment\nDrillable, sandable and Paintable with acrylics and more!\nThis is generally considered lighter and more breathable than resin.\n\nRecommended materials:\nPLA for most situations, easy to sand/paint, durable. Best choice with balance of hardness and good details.\n\nABS for Hardy situations where it will be stressed more than normal, easy to sand and paint (causes toxic fumes when creating so these will be limited).\nHard difficulty to make because of picky conditions.\n\nTPU for basically unbreakable parts in most common situations. Intermediate difficulty to sand/paint. Properties like hard phone case rubber.\nMuch higher difficulty to make and more expensive material.\n\nPLAstic Pro+\nSmoother, harder than PLA and retains slightly better details.\nEasy sanding, painting qualities.\n\nCommon questions:\nIs the jaw movable?\nYes and you are also able to take it off!\nThis makes it easier to work on your build.\n\nWhat is the RAW option?\nThe RAW option means processing time is cut off so it has a small discount applied. It works well for those on a steeper budget who are willing to post process a rougher surface edging themselves.\n\nAm I able to resell it?\nYes, you can modify to resell. I don't allow making copies of it principally and mechanically. Crediting is very appreciated!\n\nCan I use hot glue on it?\nIt accepts hot glue, industrial e5000, and even contact glue.\nIt can warp if you use too much hot glue at a time on a single spot.\nContact glue takes about 20-30 minutes to start curing and I recommend to apply in thin layers.\nYou can use contact liquid glue for modifications and repairs.\n\nI'm easy to talk to! If you have any questions feel free to ask.\nI'm also open to any feedback suggestions to improve the work.\n\n--------------\nFebruary 2021\nWood Natural added.\n\u00b0 Wood is a hybrid mulch of wood fibers mixed with PLA material.
