The cause of death was a gunshot wound to the right arm and chest. The cranial features are consistent with an individual of European ancestry. For example, the nasion is depressed, the nasal aperture is narrow/vertical, there is poor dental occlusion (overbite).\n\nThis is a 2 part skull (separate cranium & jaw).\n\nThe high quality resin gives the piece weight and a texture close to the real thing so not only does it look amazing it feels amazing to hold.\n\nProudly produced and assembled by hand in Western Australia.", "url": "https://www.etsy.com/search?q=[KW]&order=price_desc&view_type=gallery&ship_to=US&explicit=1&page=1\n"}
