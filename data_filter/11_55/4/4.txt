Yet, viewed from\nabove, the Raven's skull is fully Twice the width of a Seagull's....\n\nThe symbolic meaning of the Raven in Native American Indian lore describes\nthe raven as a creature of metamorphosis, and symbolizes change/transformation.\nIn some tribes, the Raven is considered a trickster because of its transforming/changing attributes.\nNative holy men understood that what the physical eye sees, is not necessarily\nthe truth, and he would call upon the Raven for clarity in these matters.\nForemost, the Raven is the Native American bearer of magic, and a harbinger of\nmessages from the cosmos.\n\nForever fascinating and mysterious, they live a complex life of family\nand social strata, they have a language of sounds, and they collect\nthings they like. They've even been trained to talk.\n\nThis is a casting from an Actual Raven Skull that a friend of mine found on\nthe beach near our homes. Raven skulls are very rare, and some believe\nthey hide the bones of their dead. Who knows?\n\nThis piece would bring a special energy to your own personal altar or shrine,\nand is wonderful to meditate with.\n\nThis is cast in a hard Gypsum Cement called Hydrostone, which is the\nmaterial I use to do most of my castings.\n\nThe piece measures 4 inches long and about 1.5 inches tall.\nIt has been finished in a natural look, using acrylic paints and finishes.\nEach one is slightly different in the way it takes the finishing layers,\nso know that yours will be unique in shadings and small details.\nEach casting is labeled as a specimen, and signed and dated.", "url": "https://www.etsy.com/search?q=[KW]&order=price_desc&view_type=gallery&ship_to=US&explicit=1&page=1\n"}
