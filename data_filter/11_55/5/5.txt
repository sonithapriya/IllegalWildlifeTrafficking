These will be sent without the dome being glued down so that if there is a breakage of the skeleton it can be easily fixed. We do glue every joint with superglue but these birds are top heavy and postage can treat them roughly.\n\n\nA Spotted munia or scaly-breasted munia skeleton. The bones were carefully put together and beautifully displayed in a dome. Not only this is a cool art piece, but can also inspire you in your artworks, or to study the skeletal structure.\n\nThe bird skeleton is highly adapted for flight. It is extremely lightweight but strong enough to withstand the stresses of taking off, flying, and landing. Because of this, birds usually have a smaller number of bones than other terrestrial vertebrates. Birds also lack teeth or even a true jaw, and instead have a beak, which is far more lightweight.\n\nIts name is based on the distinct scale-like feather markings on the breast and belly. This munia eats mainly grass seeds apart from berries and small insects. They forage in flocks and communicate with soft calls and whistles. The species is highly social and may sometimes roost with other species of munias. They are found in the south of Asia in tropical plains and grasslands. Breeding pairs construct dome-shaped nests using grass or bamboo leaves.\n\nDon't hesitate to contact me if you want the Skeleton in any specific position (as long as it fits inside the dome), and have a truly unique item created by you.", "url": "https://www.etsy.com/search?q=[KW]&order=price_desc&view_type=gallery&ship_to=US&explicit=1&page=1\n"}
