Most have recovered, an occaisional one is found\nby the roads. This is one, and her fragile skull was professionally cleaned at\nthe Natural History Museum in San Francisco by a friend who is a curator there.\n\nThese little owls are quite prevalent along the Northern California coast where\nI live, and hunt in the fields and meadows along the cliffs, that are rich with rodents.\n\nThe original skull is so light, so paper-like, it's hard to believe it's real.\nThe castings are a little fragile, although they'll do just fine with careful handling\nand a safe display place.\n\nThis casting is about 1 1/2 inches across and 2 1/4 inches long with bill.\nI made the original molds, and they are cast in hydrostone, a gypsum cement.\nThe acrylic washes and finishes add both the look of bone, and strength.\nAlso available in Faux Bronze finish.", "url": "https://www.etsy.com/search?q=[KW]&order=price_desc&view_type=gallery&ship_to=US&explicit=1&page=1\n"}
